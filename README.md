### Compile and Run the examples
MV-Sketch is implemented with C++. We show how to compile the examples on
Ubuntu with g++ and make.

#### Requirements
- Ensure __g++__ and __make__ are installed.  Our experimental platform is
  equipped with Ubuntu 20.0.8

- Prepare the test files.
    - You can use caida,dplp and so on to test its performance.
      

#### Compile
- Compile examples with make

```
    $ make
```

- The g++ compiler should be suitable 


#### Run
- Run the examples, and the program will output some statistics about the detection accuracy. 

```
$ ./sim
```
