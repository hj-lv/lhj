### Compile and Run the examples
MV-Sketch is implemented with C++. We show how to compile the examples on
Ubuntu with g++ and make.

#### Requirements
- Ensure __g++__ and __make__ are installed.  Our experimental platform is
  equipped with Ubuntu 20.04.

- Prepare the test files.
    - You can use twitter,caida,dplp and so on to test its performance.
      

#### Compile
- Compile examples with make.

```
    $ make
```

- The g++ compiler should be suitable.


#### Run
- Run the examples, and the program will output some statistics about the detection accuracy. 

```
    $ ./sim
```

#### Note
- You can change the data in the result.txt to change the basic configuration of the data structure.
- Before using, please check the format of the configuration file in main.cpp.
